- move all parameter references to processing_parameters.m -> set shorter feature window time and overlap (3s, 50%?)
- make tpe_autocorrelation do clustering, framewise processing, and accept any number of features.
- make beat alignment more efficient?
- integrate james's features

- fixed lag smoothing??
