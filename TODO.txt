Clean up initialisation into constructors
implement weighted phase deviation ODF
implement chroma-based odf?

think about normalising features (to power 1?) before tempo/phase estimation stage
-> OR normalise autocorrelation area and beat alignment area to 1, then confidence is product of heights -> probability.
-> make a 'normalise = 1' option for autocorrelation and beat alignment

use a shorter feature window. But maybe still calculate autocorrelation using previous (non-overlapping) frame?
