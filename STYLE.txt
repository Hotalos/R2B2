Hi everyone, I thought since we're probably going to have multiple people
working on this repo, we should have some sort of style guide for MATLAB code.

These aren't hard and fast rules, it's just what I tend to do and I'm used to
it. I'm open to suggestions if anyone feels really strongly about something.

With that said, here are some current style things:

1.
	use tabs for indenting and spaces for lining up equals signs or comments.
	This way you can set your preferred indenting amount using the tab width, but
	everything will still be vertically aligned.

2.
	Minimise 'squishing together' of operators, except for brackets
	e.g. for k = 1:n
	not  for k=1:n
	but something like y = m*x + b is okay.
	e.g. A = calculate_thing(x);
	not  A = calculate_thing( x );
	if in doubt, use your judgement and be consistent.

3.
	Increase indent one level after every loop/conditional,
	function declaration, method/properties block, etc.
	Basically the only time that you don't need to do this is
	for a classdef (or possibly for a function in its own file)
	where you'd be indenting the whole file, which is pointless.

4.
	Use informative variable names, even if they're long :)
