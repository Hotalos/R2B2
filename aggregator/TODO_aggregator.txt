TO DO
- write plot_cluster method and use it to clean up aggregator_demo
- write classes for 'cluster' 'cluster_set' and 'phase_cluster_matrix' to improve readability
- add print 'points_in_cluster' 'print_points_in_cluster_set' and 'print_points_in_cluster_matrix' methods to the test class
- don't check all tempo harmonics when phase clustering...
- fix get_centre_of_mass for phase
- get phase clustering working...
- phase clustering shouldn't need to find evidence for it's own tempo cluster (i.e. when i = 1)

we should first cluster points as a way of reducing the number of distinct estimates, combining the confidences of each cluster in order to end up with a small number of candidate tempo/phase locations. Then do Dan's harmonic thing, completely agnostic to what was a cluster to pick the most likely candidate
